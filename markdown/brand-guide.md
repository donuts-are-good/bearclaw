# brand guide

what the heck is a bearclaw, you might ask in whatever your native language is. hopefully this guide answers that question and more.

## the name

bearclaw got the name because my username is @donuts-are-good, and i just wanted something cute, easily spelled and easily said that wasn't taken already for the repo name. the only reuirement was that it be a hair more attractive than "md-to-html".

obviously though the code is adequate, bearclaw isn't solving any of the great unknowns of humanity, so we need to rely on things that are cute and approachable to draw people in... let's do the donut thing.


## the logo

it's the bear emoji, because there's no donut specificity in the currrent emoji specification. the colors were chosen for being attractive, using whatever the first link for 'random color pallette palete pallete palette generator" returned and choosing the top-ranked color combo, skewed slightly to not look like it's dividing the letters.

it's okay i guess. i tried to draw an actual bearclaw from memory and it looked more like a top-down view of something else ðŸ’©.

also, how is it 2023 and the donut emoji still looks disgusting? give me a simpsons-pink glaze with rainbow sprinkles, come on.

## the font

it was from fonts.google.com, can't remember the name, but it is saved somewhere. will verify later. it's possible the kerning had to be adjusted because i remember the letters not being spaced right the first time.

## fonts, in bearclaw itself

bearclaw doesn't include much with regards to fonts. it uses bootstrap css as a courtesy to your eyeballs. 

in the early days of the internet, what fonts to use was at the discretion of the user's browser. we reference font families, or rather font properties rather than importing new fonts for everything. 

- monospace for some titles
- sans serif for the rest

bearclaw is simple.
bearclaw is tiny.

bearclaw is not a network soup of requests on each pageload.
