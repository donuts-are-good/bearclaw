# donate

bearclaw used to have donation addresses for bitcoin and monero. at the time it was only me, and nobody donated anything, which wasn't entirely unexpected. however, now there are more contributors than just me, and it would be unfair to solicit donations on the work of others.

if you still want to give, and you want to support bearclaw, pick any charity or any good deed, and go do it. find someone who needs help and dig them out of their hole. you don't have to name anybody or tell anybody why.
