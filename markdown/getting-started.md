# getting started
you don't need anything special, it's easy.

1. Download bearclaw [here](https://github.com/donuts-are-good/bearclaw/releases/latest)

    *note: github is just a website we use as developers to share our code. at the bottom of the page at this link, there are a bunch of files. pick the one for your system and download it.*

2. Put bearclaw in any folder, then run it. Bearclaw will ask a few questions, then set up the folders it needs and won't touch anything else.


3. One of those folders is called [`markdown`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-markdown/). Put your [`.md`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-markdown/) documents here.

4. Run bearclaw to convert your [`.md`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-markdown/) files to .html in the `output` folder.

You now have a website, ready to go without needing to know any HTML.
