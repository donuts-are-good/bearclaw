# join bearclaw

## in general

thanks for your interest :) as the goal with bearclaw is simplicity and less moving parts, as a contributor you agree to do your best to be cool and manage your own interactions.

## for developers

bearclaw is written in go, and uses vanilla html and simple css. there is a code styleguide, but to sum it up, focus on stdlib, comment everything, write code as if your pets need to submit your patches. simple simple simple. for more information, consult thhe code styleguide.

## for artists

i'm not an artist, and the bearclaw branding so far has been luckily cute and accessible. some day we might need shirts, laptop stickers,  or something like that, and it'd be useful to know artists who can offer advice about these things so we dont show up to conferences with monogrammed patagonias or off-center iron-on t-shirt logos.

## for marketers

its easy to tell a developer what bearclaw is and what it's for and what problems it addresses, but normal folk have no clue what a static site generator is. some pointers about how to discover our own brand messaging is good probably.


## in general, cont'd
none of this is saying "hey you, unknown person, do work for free then bestow it upon us" it just means if you're an expert in one of these, or you want to develop your skills in one of these, your opinion is valued and we're happy to have your input. in no way is this an expectation that you should lift a finger on bearclaw's behalf. 

## so...

if you think bearclaw is cool, and you think you have some opinions that can help out, it'd be great to have you.
